## About The Game

The Farming Game is a simple 2D simulation where players can grow crops, manage a small farm, and earn points based on how well they take care of their crops. The game includes a variety of interactive gameplay mechanics such as crop growth, time management, and an engaging environment with various challenges like cows pushing players around and the potential for rain.

### Features:
- **Crop Growth**: Grow a variety of crops, each with its own growth time and points value.
- **Time Management**: Start a new day by visiting your house to manage crops and plan for growth.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Includes cows that push players around and a random chance of rain at the start of each new day.
- **Chicken Companion**: A chicken follows the player around the island for added fun.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with other players by earning points and climbing the leaderboard. The leaderboard is sortable by name and score (ascending and descending).

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the core game logic and interactive gameplay mechanics.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface and dynamic user interactions.
- **HTML**: For the basic structure and layout of the game.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Used for structuring the game code, making it modular and easy to extend.

## Installation

To get the game up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zoe-zentner/NEA.git
```

### 2. Open the game:

After cloning the repository, run the game on a local server.

My prefered way is through Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- Install the Live Server extension in VS Code from the Extensions Marketplace.
- Open the project folder in VS Code and right-click on index.html.
- Select "Open with Live Server" to run the game in your browser

### 3. Play the game:

- Start by planting your first crop.
- Each crop has a different growth time; keep track of them to maximize your points.
- Once the crops are ready, harvest them to earn points.
- The leaderboard will display your score once you finish the game.
- Keep playing to get the highest score possible!

## How It Works

### Game Flow:
1. The game starts by providing the player with an empty plot of land.
2. Players can select and plant crops on the land.
3. Each crop requires a set amount of time to grow, which advances when the player starts a new day.
4. Players must manage their time and resources wisely to maximize the number of crops they can grow in the given time.
5. When crops are ready, the player can harvest them and trade them for points with the merchant.
6. The game ends when the player decides to stop playing, and the leaderboard updates with their score and name.

### Gameplay Features:
- **Crops**: Different crops take varying amounts of time to grow. The player must decide the best crops to grow based on available time.
- **Time Management**: The player must visit their house to start a new day and manage their crops efficiently.
- **Cows**: Cows will push the player around the island, adding a fun passtime.
- **Leaderboards**: Points from harvested crops contribute to the player's overall score, and the leaderboard can be sorted by name and score (ascending or descending).
